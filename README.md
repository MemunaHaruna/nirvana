# Nirvana

A Ruby rack-based application server - for fun and learning.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nirvana'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nirvana

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

`something.ru` contains a sample ruby rack-compliant app. Pass `something.ru` to the app using `bundle exec nirvana ./something.ru` to test.

## Improvements
- Add tests
- Create an actual test ruby app with a few basic middlewares to be served by this server
- Prettify logs
